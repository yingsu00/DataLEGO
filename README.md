### Fast SIMD Data Operations 

This repository will be used to host the common data manipulation components I built and will be building when developing Velox and Prestissimo. Most of them will be using SIMD and specially optimized for Intel main stream processors. There will be tests and benchmarks comparing to other similar implementations. 

Some of these common components include:
- Bit Unpacking
- Bit Unpacking with Selectivity Map or Row Sets
- Bit Mask and Row Set conversions
- Sorting integers
- Parquet Definition and Repetition Level Decoders
- Aggregation functions

Over the time the contents will expand more areas.
